# Part 1

1. Implement 2 columns vertically max height, and resizable horizontally.
2. Ensure the code works when placing this in any container.
3. Produce the same effect for 2 horizontal panes.
4. Modify (1) for 3 panes.
5. Determine the logic of how the other 2 panes should resize: equally? proportionately? Once one is dragged to zero, should it have a knockon effect where the drag motion continues and carries on dragging the pane next to it?

# Part 2

1. Make it possible to nest infinitely, and minimise the panes that are not being read.
2. Add a rule where only 6 panes are visible at any one time. Others are automatcally minimised based on some relationship to the position of the most recently expanded pane.
