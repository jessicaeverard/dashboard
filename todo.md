1. Implement 2 columns vertically max height, and resizable horizontally.
2. Ensure the code works when placing this in any container.
3. Produce the same effect for 2 horizontal panes.
4. Modify (1) for 3 panes.
5. Determine the logic of how the other 2 panes should resize: equally? proportionately? Once one is dragged to zero, should it have a knockon effect where the drag motion continues and carries on dragging the pane next to it?
