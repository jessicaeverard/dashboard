# Dashboard

## Panels

1. Columns are simply divisions with a full height and either fixed or variable width.
a) What interactions are there?
b) How is it all affected by different screen sizes?

2. Always choose your devices.
3. Always know the browsers and versions.

4. Which browser vendors are keeping up with the standard?
5. Are users even using the latest browser?
6. Polyfills can bridge the delay between a new standard, and its device-wide implementation.

7. Graceful degradataion - website does not break without explanation, it either copes without, or states it cannot work.
8. Another word is 'fallback' or 'shiv', a fallback is either catered for in your design, or you rely on a polyfill to enable the behaviour you need.


# AJAX

1. Code a full page reload first
2. Hijack links with JS
